## Analysis of visibilities affects on item sales.
 ### We often go to store and just grab the first thing we see. By looking at the data we can see how well can item does in that prime realistate and should focus on that resource. also, How much does the weight of an product affect it's visibility.





 ### Data shows that we have not done much to improve the visibility of our products. Last time changed happened was in 1998.

 ### It would also help if we moved higher priced items to different shelving or set up display cases at the end of the isles.

### Data Methods
I believe that these were the onlky two methods allowed to use and with tuning the Decision tree would be the best model to use because of the low bias and variance.

## Recommendation
Its my opinion that we should concentrate of the visibility of an item in our stores. If we want some of our better quality and hiogher priced items to sell we need to place them in shelves that the average consummer would look. Since havent had a big change since 1998 that should be our first project.
Secondly the weight of the item has alot to do in where they are placed. We can look at different formes of displaying items so that they can be easier to see. this can be tested through surveys to our custoimers to narrow our scope.
