During cleaning and analysis to the data. I created a box plot to show the visibility of the item by the year the store was established.

I also ran a scatterplot to see how visibility did on sales.

## Exploratory Data
 While exploring the data it seemed that we have not done much to improve visibility of our products. Last time changed happened was in 1998. 
 It would alsop help if we moved higher priced items to different shelving or set up display cases at the end of the isles.
