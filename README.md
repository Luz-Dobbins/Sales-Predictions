## Analysis of visibilities affects on item sales.
### We often go to the store and just grab the first thing we see. By looking at the data we can see how well an item does in that prime realestate and should focus on that resource. also, How much does the weight of a product affect it's visibility?
 
 
 ### It would also help if we moved higher priced items to different shelving or set up display cases at the end of the isles.

### You can see that Breakfast has one of the highest visibility scores because of the colorful boxes and how they usually take up a whole aisle in a store.

## Recommendation
It is my opinion that we should concentrate on the visibility of an item in our stores. If we want some of our better quality and higher priced items to sell we need to place them on shelves that the average consumer would look at since haven't had a significant change since 1998 that should be our first project.
Secondly, the item's weight has a lot to do with where they are placed. We can look at different forms of displaying items so that they can be easier to see. this can be tested through surveys to our customers to narrow our scope.
